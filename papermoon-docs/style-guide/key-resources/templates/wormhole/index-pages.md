# Wormhole Index Pages

## Introduction

This page is a guide to using the index page template for Wormhole index pages to ensure the pages are informative and aid in navigation to add user value. In the following sections, you'll learn how to plan an effective index page, the required elements, and guidance for styling and formatting these pages.

## Before You Start Writing

You will have an easier time creating an effective index page if you plan and organize your ideas before you start writing page content. Keeping in mind the two goals of being informative and aiding in navigation, consider the following:

- **Call to Action Links** - do any CTA buttons or links lead to this page? If so, is the content promoted by the CTA included, complete, and easy to find?
- **Consider Your Audience** - who will most likely land on this page? What are they most likely looking for from this page?
- **Tell a Story** - what story do you want to tell the user who lands on this page? Why should they spend time on this section? What do you want them to know or find from here?

## Style Guidance

All Wormhole index pages should include the following items:

- **SEO-friendly meta title** - between 34 and 44 characters. This title plus the copy "| Wormhole Docs" should equal 50 to 60 characters in total
- **SEO-friendly meta description** - between 120 and 160 characters
- **H1 heading page title** - this is the title that will render at the top of the page and may be different than the meta title
- **Content or body text** - this will be different for each page. All index pages should guide the user journey and, when appropriate, describe products or use cases
    - **User journey** - all index pages are part of the roadmap to guide the user along their journey in discovering and using the product
    - **Product description** - if the page links to one or more products, add a project description for each product
- **Cards for navigation links** - these cards should match the navigation options for the page
- **Related Resources** (optional) - bulleted list of informational resources related to the page contents or relevant Reference page entries
- **Where to Go Next** (optional) - bulleted list of guides and tutorials related to the page contents
