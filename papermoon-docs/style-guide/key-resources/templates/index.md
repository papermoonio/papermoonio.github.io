# Templates

## Introduction

Templates are a tool to help ensure consistency and quality across our work product. They also act as boilerplate code to reduce repetitive work for creators as they develop new pieces of content. The templates in this section draw heavily upon the work of [The Good Docs Project](https://www.thegooddocsproject.dev/){target=\_blank} which is rooted in the principles of [Diataxis](https://diataxis.fr/){target=\_blank}.

This section provides templates for Diataxis's four main documentation types: tutorial, how-to guide, concept, and reference. Review the following information to choose the right template based on your users' needs.

## How-To Use the Templates

Deciding which template best suits the content you want to create can be tricky, especially when differentiating tutorials from how-to guides. The following sections guide you through selecting the best template category and link to available templates by project.  

### Concept

The concept template is used for informational pages to increase the user's understanding of a topic. Concept pages are typically grouped under a section. Concept section names per project are as follows:

| Project  | Concept page section |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Moonbeam | Learn                |
| Polkadot | Polkadot Protocol    |
| Tanssi   | Learn                |
| Wormhole | Learn                |

### How-To Guide

The how-to guide template is used for instructional pages to help users solve real-world problems or complete tasks. 

It can be helpful to think about cooking when deciding between a how-to guide and a tutorial. Someone who knows how to cook can use a recipe with a complete list of requirements (ingredients, equipment) and clear, orderly steps to follow. A recipe assumes the user understands the meaning of "sautee the onions" or "bake until golden brown." Some context, like "the dough will be sticky," may be added for things that differ from what the user expects. The required items and steps will get the job done for the most part.

How-to guide pages are typically grouped under a section. How-to guide section names by project are as follows:

| Project  | How-to guide section |
|:---------|:---------------------|
| Moonbeam | Builders             |
| Polkadot | Develop              |
| Tanssi   | Builders             |
| Wormhole | Build                |
